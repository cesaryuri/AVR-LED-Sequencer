# AVR-LED-Sequencer
 This repository contains the source code for a simple LED sequencer implemented on an AVR microcontroller. The program is designed to control LEDs connected to PORTD by lighting them up sequentially and then dimming them in reverse order. The sequence is triggered and controlled by a button connected to PORTB.
